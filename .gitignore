# hint: A leading "**" followed by a slash means match in all directories. 
# For example, "**/foo" matches file or directory "foo" anywhere, the same 
# as pattern "foo". "**/foo/bar" matches file or directory "bar" anywhere 
# that is directly under directory "foo".
# An optional prefix "!" which negates the pattern; any matching file 
# excluded by a previous pattern will become included again.
